# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About me

I'm a self-taught web developer hailing from the beautiful Czech Republic. I've had the pleasure of crafting some pretty nifty personal web applications. My goal is to develop visually appealing, user-friendly, and robust web applications for the end users, and meet their unique needs.

During my free time, I often find myself immersed in the world of digital art, where I can let my creativity run wild. Additionally, I'm a big fan of combat sports, and there's nothing like the rush of adrenaline that comes from training and sparrings.
