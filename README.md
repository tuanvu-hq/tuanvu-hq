# Hi there 👋

You can find my portfolio [here](https://tvhq.vercel.app/).

## About me

I'm a self-taught web developer hailing from the beautiful Czech Republic. I've had the pleasure of crafting some pretty nifty personal web applications. My goal is to develop visually appealing, user-friendly, and robust web applications for the end users, and meet their unique needs.

During my free time, I often find myself immersed in the world of digital art, where I can let my creativity run wild. Additionally, I'm a big fan of combat sports, and there's nothing like the rush of adrenaline that comes from training and sparrings.

Front-end:

- HTML5, CSS3, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- React.js, Next.js, Solid.js, Angular

Back-end:

- Node.js, Nest.js, Puppeteer, Cheerio, Prisma, SQLite

Mobile:

- Ionic, Capacitor, React Native, Flutter

Other technologies & tools:

- Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Java, JSF, Java EE, Python
- Git
- VS Code, Affinity Designer, Blender
